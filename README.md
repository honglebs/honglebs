## 👋 Greetings, mission briefing begins now!

![til](assets/rainbow-line.gif)

Hello world! 🌎 I’m **Hong Le** (she/her), a dreamer disguised as a coder, blending creativity, logic, and just a touch of madness to turn ideas into reality (and bugs into... smaller bugs?). I dabble in everything from crafting maps and satellite projects to wrestling bugs in real-time (I always win, of course 💪). Whether it’s building slick software, securing cyberspace, or dreaming about soaring through the clouds as a pilot, I tackle challenges with a smile, a bit of sarcasm, and maybe a bad pun or two.  

But that’s just one side of me. The other? Well...

I am a **professional procrastinator**, excelling at doing absolutely nothing in the most spectacular way imaginable. Sometimes, I’m an overzealous, impulsive, **megalomaniacal** human convinced of my own greatness — other times, just your average **existential crisis in a hoodie**.  

Long ago, I was the metaphysical embodiment of **rainbows and happiness**, an unseen spirit drifting through the winds. That was until I got captured by humans, grounded to reality, and tasked with making people laugh and smile. Fun fact: those same laughs and smiles are now powering a mega mech that will _probably_ obliterate Earth someday. But for now, yay! **Rainbows!!** 🌈  

As a part-time **sky-gazer** and a full-time **creative chaos engineer**, I wield my keyboard and over-caffeinated imagination to bring wild ideas to life. If you're into **tech**, **anarchy**, or **bad puns**, we’re probably going to get along just fine. Let’s connect and make something awesome together! 🚀
